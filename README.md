## 🛠️ Requirements

* 🐍 Python 3.7+
* 🎭 Playwright Python package

---

## 📥 Installation

1. Install Playwright and its browsers:

   ```bash
   pip install playwright
   ```

   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

2. Save the script (e.g., `monkeytype_bot.py`). 💾

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python monkeytype_bot.py
```

* 🤔 When prompted, choose whether to log in (`y` or `n`).
* 📝 If logging in, enter your username and password.
* 🎛️ Choose whether to set a particular typing speed (`y` or `n`).
* ⌨️ If yes, enter the desired speed as an integer (word count target).
* 🤖 The bot will automatically type words on the page.
* ⏹️ Press Enter to stop the script after the test.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* 🖥️ The script opens a Chromium browser window (not headless) so you can watch the bot in action.
* 🔑 Make sure your credentials are correct for login to work.
* ⏲️ Typing speed control approximates the number of words typed.
* ❌ If the speed is too high, it may invalidate the WPM and won’t count as a legit test.
